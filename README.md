*A simple service to help jump those cultural barriers.* ![](https://secure.travis-ci.org/LuaDist/etree.png?branch=master)

## About

Ever had a conversation with someone where they mention a word or phrase that just doesn't make sense? This is the site for you.

**saywat** is intended to help capture and share the idiosyncracies of various cultures so that others can follow conversations quickly.
While other sites do an excellent job of capturing and discussing latest trends, saywat is interested in the fundamentals and words and phrases in common use.

## Getting Started

[Read this first](https://github.com/Code52/saywat/wiki/Getting-Started).

The [wiki](https://github.com/Code52/saywat/wiki) has some details about getting started and fleshing out the application.

The Code52 JabbR [chatroom](http://jabbr.net/#/rooms/code52) is usually the hub of activity if you have questions or would like to discuss things.

## Why?

Several reasons:

 - an excuse to learn nodejs - personally I always learn better when i can do something practical with new tools/languages/concepts.
 - the code will be OSS - hopefully it is useful as a learning tool
 - the site itself might actually be useful to others

## Examples

**wat** (noun, internet): a response to something that makes absolutely no sense.

**arvo** (noun, Australia): abbreviation for *afternoon*. Example: "will you be around this arvo?"
